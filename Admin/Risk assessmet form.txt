HAZARD
1.) Ground control User interface may interfer with transmission of joystick control 
Sensitivity: 4 
Likelihood : 4
Risk : 16
Control: Implement interrupts-conditional statemets methodology to prevent UI from blocking the transmission of joystick values for a significant amount of time, ensuring smooth ground control.
Controlled sensitivity: 4
Controlled Likelihood: 1
Risk: 4
2.) Mishandling of the ESC.
Sensitivity : 4
Linkeihood : 3
Risk : 12
Control: Ensure we comply with ESC's handling guidelines.Confirm correct wiring of the ESC's before applying power. Make sure each ECS is calibrated to control the motors with the given control signals.
Controlled sensitivity: 3
Controlled Likelihood: 2
Risk: 6
3.) Lack of protection from propellers
Sensitvity: 2
Linkeihood :5
Risk: 10
Control: make sure that the motors are not running when a team member is close to them. Considerations are made to the shattie design to include blade guards.
Controlled Sensitvity : 2
Controlled Likelihood : 2
Controlled Risk: 4
4.) Improper use of the power supply
Sensitivity: 4
Likelihood : 3
Risk : 12
Control : Read the online resources and spec sheets to properly utilise this suppply to deliver the adequate power needed to run all four motors.
Also use any relevant measurement tools (eg. multimeters) for checking the voltages and currents between the supply to the ESCs to the Motors.
